# Collect Ephemeral Drop

Collects an ephemeral drop by verifying that it exists, if its date is in the past, and the account owns the drop. If all conditions are met, it mints tokens and updates the drop status.

## Parameters

- `mark`: The unique identifier for the drop.

## Return Value

- `ICRC1.TransferResult`: The method returns information about the minting operation.

## Example Call

Here's an example call using Dfinity Motoko language:

```
func collectEphemeralDropExample() {
  let mark = "my_unique_drop";
  let result = await collectEphemeralDrop(mark);
  switch (result) {
    case (#Ok(block)) {
      // The drop was collected successfully
      print("Drop collected!");
    };
    case (#Err(err)) {
      // An error occurred while collecting the drop
      print("Error: " # debug_show(err));
    };
  }
};
```

Note that this example assumes you have already set up a principal reference to call the `collectEphemeralDrop` method.
