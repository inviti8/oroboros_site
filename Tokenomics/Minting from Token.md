### Mint Requirements

Users who mint XRO for ICP or Chain Key tokens are called 'Generators' on the Oroboros network. There can only be one Generatot per ICP Principal on the network.  Which means, for a user to mint more than once, they would need to create a new Principal with unique seed phrase each time they want to mint a batch of tokens. This is discourage multiple mint batches for a single user.

### Mint Cost

XRO is mintable in exchange for ICP and Chain Key tokens.  The cost of minting is mathematically designed to stay relatively stable over time. Once the max number of Generators(Depositors) is met, the cost to mint the token will reach parity with the actual price of the corresponding Chain Key token.
